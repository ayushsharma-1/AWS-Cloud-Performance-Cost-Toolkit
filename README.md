# AWS-Cloud-Performance-Cost-Toolkit
Comprehensive AWS cost optimization, monitoring, and CloudFront optimization for Next.js apps.

### 1. **AWS Cost Optimization (25 points)**

**Key Areas for Cost Reduction:**

1. **Lambda ($418.41):**
   - **Action**: Review and optimize function execution times and memory usage.
   - **Potential Savings**: By lowering allocated memory or optimizing execution times, costs can drop significantly. Consider reserving capacity for predictable workloads to achieve further savings. The trade-off here might be performance impact for latency-sensitive applications.

2. **EC2 Instances ($135.57):**
   - **Action**: Leverage EC2 instance right-sizing and spot instances for less critical workloads.
   - **Potential Savings**: By moving underutilized instances to smaller sizes or switching to spot instances, savings of up to 70% are possible. However, the trade-off would be potential instance termination in the case of spot instances.

3. **CloudWatch ($73.68):**
   - **Action**: Optimize log retention and reduce the frequency of high-resolution alarms.
   - **Potential Savings**: By adjusting log retention policies and limiting high-resolution metrics, unnecessary costs for data retention and extra alarms can be eliminated. Trade-offs may involve a reduced window for troubleshooting.


### 2. **Monitoring and Alerting (25 points)**

**CloudWatch Dashboard Design:**

A well-designed CloudWatch dashboard should provide real-time visibility into the health and performance of critical AWS services. Below is a mockup structure of a CloudWatch dashboard:

- **EC2 Monitoring:**
  - CPU Utilization
  - Network In/Out
  - Disk Read/Write
- **Lambda Monitoring:**
  - Invocations
  - Duration
  - Errors
- **S3 Monitoring:**
  - Bucket size by region
  - Request count
  - 4xx/5xx error rates

**Alarms:**

- **EC2 High CPU Alarm:**
  - **Metric**: `CPUUtilization > 85% for 5 minutes`
  - **Action**: Scale EC2 instances or investigate high-load applications.
  - **Notification**: Set up an AWS SNS notification to email or SMS when this threshold is breached.

- **Lambda Error Rate Alarm:**
  - **Metric**: `Errors > 5 within 1 minute`
  - **Action**: Trigger automatic rollback or scaling operations in case of high error rates.
  - **Notification**: AWS SNS notifications to inform developers of function errors.

**SNS Notification Setup:**
1. Create an SNS topic (e.g., "CriticalAlerts").
2. Subscribe team members via email or SMS.
3. Attach the SNS topic to CloudWatch alarms for real-time notifications.


### 3. **CloudFront Optimization for Next.js Application (50 points)**

**a) High Availability:**
   - **Strategy**: Use CloudFront's origin failover feature with multiple origins (primary: Lambda@Edge, secondary: static S3 bucket) to ensure availability.
   - **Testing**: Simulate failover by intentionally causing failure at the primary origin (Lambda@Edge) and ensuring requests are rerouted to the secondary (S3).
   - **Benefits**: Ensures uninterrupted service even if the main origin fails.

**b) Bot Attack Mitigation:**
   - **Method**: Implement AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) with rate-limiting rules.
   - **Rate Limiting**: Set limits on the number of requests per IP (e.g., 100 requests per 5 minutes).
   - **Benefits**: Protects against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and prevents overuse of resources.

**c) SEO Crawler Allowance:**
   - **Implementation**: Use AWS WAF to block malicious bots while allowing legitimate SEO crawlers by filtering User-Agent strings (e.g., "Googlebot", "Bingbot").
   - **IP List**: Maintain a list of allowed IPs for legitimate crawlers.
   - **Benefits**: Ensures SEO indexing while blocking unwanted traffic.

**d) Monitoring:**
   - **Key Metrics**:
     - Cache Hit Rate
     - Origin Latency
     - Request count
     - 4xx/5xx error rates
   - **Logging and Analysis**: Enable CloudFront access logs and integrate with AWS CloudWatch Logs for further analysis using AWS Athena.

**e) Site Loading Time Optimization:**
   - **Methods**:
     1. **Gzip Compression**: Enable Gzip compression in CloudFront to reduce the size of transmitted data.
     2. **Cache TTL Tuning**: Adjust Time-to-Live (TTL) values to cache content longer, reducing origin fetches.
     3. **Edge Locations**: Leverage all available CloudFront edge locations for quicker content delivery to users globally.
   - **Measurement**: Use Amazon CloudWatch and CloudFront logs to measure response times and overall load performance before and after optimization.

Looking at the traffic pattern in the first image (Lambda function cost over time), we see that most days have very low usage, with a significant spike on specific dates. This kind of pattern suggests that Lambda functions don't require high resources all the time, only during certain events.

Here are my thoughts on optimizing Lambda costs based on this pattern:

### **1. Dynamic Provisioned Concurrency with Auto Scaling (Event-Based Triggers)**

Instead of maintaining Provisioned Concurrency (PC) consistently, you can automate the scaling of concurrency based on traffic patterns using **EventBridge** or **Scheduled Scaling**:

- **Explanation**: Since traffic spikes happen only on specific days, you can automate the switch to a higher provisioned concurrency level during these high-traffic periods. AWS EventBridge (or CloudWatch Events) can trigger an increase in Lambda provisioned concurrency when traffic is expected, such as during business hours, daily data processinAg jobs, or other predictable patterns.
  
- **Action**: Use **Application Auto Scaling** or schedule scaling rules to automatically increase or decrease the concurrency limits of Lambda functions based on time of day or expected events. For instance, on the 18th-21st in the graph, you can increase the concurrency and reduce it afterward to a lower level.

- **Potential Savings**: By scaling concurrency up only during high-traffic periods and reducing it during low-traffic times, you save on the costs associated with keeping provisioned concurrency constantly available. This method could potentially cut your provisioned concurrency costs by 30-40% during low-traffic periods while maintaining performance during peak hours.
  
- **Trade-offs**: You may need to accurately predict your traffic patterns to avoid performance degradation. If unexpected spikes occur outside the scheduled time, it could lead to higher latency due to cold starts.

### **2. Lambda on Demand with Reserved Instances for Specific Functions**

Since your Lambda traffic pattern seems to be flat with occasional spikes, another option is to rely on **on-demand** invocation most of the time, but use **Reserved Instances** for predictable workloads.

- **Explanation**: For the majority of the days, you don't need high levels of concurrency. You could run Lambda purely on-demand, without PC. For predictable spikes, you could reserve specific instances to handle those bursts.

- **Action**: Use **AWS Lambda Reserved Instances** for specific periods (like the spike in the image) where traffic is predictable and high, while scaling down to on-demand functions during lower traffic periods.

- **Potential Savings**: Reserved Instances offer discounts compared to on-demand pricing, so during high-traffic days, you can lock in lower costs. This approach can reduce overall Lambda costs by 25-30%.

- **Trade-offs**: Reserved Instances work best for consistent and predictable workloads. If traffic spikes are irregular or unpredictable, it might be less efficient than simply using on-demand Lambda or auto-scaling.

### **3. Use **AWS Step Functions** for High Traffic Workflows**
   - **Explanation**: If the spike in traffic is due to a specific workflow that is very resource-heavy, you could move parts of the workload to **AWS Step Functions**, which allow you to orchestrate Lambda executions and reduce concurrent invocations. Step Functions allow for better control of workflows by breaking them into smaller, manageable steps, reducing the memory and execution time of individual Lambdas.

   - **Potential Savings**: By optimizing workflow control and ensuring that each Lambda function performs minimal tasks, you can reduce costs by optimizing memory and execution time. Savings could be around 15-25% if optimized properly.
   
   - **Trade-offs**: Implementing Step Functions may require redesigning your current Lambda-based architecture, which may take significant effort and testing. However, it can significantly reduce complexity in handling spikes by introducing flow control.


### **Conclusion:**

Based on your graph, using dynamic, scheduled provisioning of Lambda concurrency looks like the most effective strategy to save costs while maintaining high performance during peak times. Combining it with auto-scaling and reserved instances can bring further savings. 

If you want a traffic graph that shows requests/invocations, we could explore even finer-grained scaling options. Just let me know what you need!
