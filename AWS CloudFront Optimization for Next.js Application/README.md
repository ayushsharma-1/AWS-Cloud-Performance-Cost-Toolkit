### **CloudFront Optimization for Next.js Application**

---

#### **Overview:**
The frontend is a Next.js application hosted on AWS Lambda using SST (Serverless Stack), with CloudFront acting as the CDN (Content Delivery Network). This document addresses key concerns, including high availability, bot attack mitigation, monitoring, and site loading time optimization, and provides recommendations for ensuring performance, security, and efficient monitoring.

### **a) High Availability**

#### **Objective:**
To ensure the highest availability of the Next.js application through CloudFront, even in the event of origin failure or downtime.

#### **Proposed Strategy:**

1. **Multi-Origin Failover:**
   - CloudFront can be configured with multiple origins (such as Lambda@Edge functions deployed in multiple AWS regions).
   - Create **Origin Groups** in CloudFront that define a primary and secondary origin. If the primary origin becomes unavailable, CloudFront automatically routes traffic to the secondary origin.

2. **Health Checks:**
   - Set up health checks for each origin within CloudFront. These checks continuously monitor the health of the primary origin, and if the check fails (e.g., HTTP 5xx status codes), traffic is routed to the secondary origin.

#### **Steps for Setting up Failover:**

1. In the **CloudFront Console**, create a new CloudFront distribution or modify an existing one.
2. Add **multiple origins** (e.g., primary and secondary Lambda@Edge or regional S3 buckets).
3. Under **Origins and Origin Groups**, configure an **Origin Group** with both the primary and secondary origins, with a priority list for failover.
4. Enable **Health Checks** and configure them to monitor a specific path (e.g., `/health-check`) that returns a status code like 200.
5. Specify **Failover Conditions** by defining which HTTP status codes (such as 5xx) will trigger traffic rerouting.

#### **Testing Failover Scenarios:**
1. **Simulate Origin Failure**: Temporarily take down or disable the primary origin (e.g., by disabling the Lambda function).
2. **Monitor CloudFront Behavior**: Using AWS CloudWatch or CloudFront metrics, verify that requests are being rerouted to the secondary origin when the primary fails.
3. **Re-enable Primary Origin**: Once the primary origin is back online, confirm that CloudFront automatically resumes traffic routing to it.

### **b) Bot Attack Mitigation**

#### **Objective:**
To reduce the likelihood and impact of bot attacks, including DDoS attacks, scraping, and brute-force attacks on the CloudFront distribution.

#### **Proposed Methods:**

1. **AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - Integrate AWS WAF with the CloudFront distribution to block or throttle malicious bot traffic. AWS WAF can filter incoming requests based on patterns, IP addresses, user-agent strings, and geographic locations.

2. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Use **Rate-Based Rules** within AWS WAF to limit the number of requests a single IP address can make within a specific time frame. Excessive requests are blocked, preventing overloading of the backend or APIs.
   
   **Implementation Steps:**
   1. In **AWS WAF**, create a **Web ACL** (Access Control List) for the CloudFront distribution.
   2. Define a **Rate-Based Rule**: Specify a threshold (e.g., 100 requests per 5 minutes) to block abusive IP addresses.
   3. Attach this Web ACL to the **CloudFront distribution**.

#### **Benefits of Rate Limiting:**
- **Mitigates DDoS Attacks**: Rate limiting reduces the chance of successful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by preventing large numbers of requests from a single source.
- **Prevents Scraping**: Aggressive bots that scrape content or perform brute-force attacks are effectively slowed down, improving application security.

### **c) SEO Crawler Allowance**

#### **Objective:**
To allow legitimate SEO crawlers such as Googlebot, Bingbot, and other reputable search engines while blocking malicious bots that could scrape content or overload the server.

#### **Proposed Approach:**

1. **Identify Legitimate SEO Crawlers:**
   - Legitimate crawlers from search engines have well-known **User-Agent strings** and **IP ranges**. For example, Googlebot and Bingbot have distinct identifiers that can be used to differentiate them from malicious bots.

   **Examples of Legitimate SEO Crawler User-Agents:**
   - Googlebot: `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)`
   - Bingbot: `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; bingbot/2.0; +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm)`

2. **User-Agent Filtering:**
   **User-Agent strings** are a simple method to identify different bots. You can use them to whitelist or block crawlers.

   **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Whitelist Legitimate Crawlers:** Create rules on your server or web application firewall (WAF) to allow requests from legitimate User-Agent strings.
   
   **Example Configuration (Apache):**
   ```apache
   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
       RewriteEngine On
       # Allow Googlebot and Bingbot
       RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Googlebot [OR]
       RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Bingbot
       RewriteRule ^ - [L]
       
       # Block all other bots
       RewriteRule ^ - [F]
   </IfModule>
   ```

   - **Block Malicious Bots:** Use the same technique to block User-Agent strings associated with known malicious bots or scrapers.

   **Example (Apache):**
   ```apache
   <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
       RewriteEngine On
       # Block known malicious bots
       RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} BadBot [OR]
       RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} EvilScraper
       RewriteRule ^ - [F]
   </IfModule>
   ```

3. **IP Whitelisting and Blacklisting:**
   - Many legitimate crawlers, like Googlebot, come from specific IP ranges, which can be whitelisted. Conversely, malicious bots often originate from known IP addresses that can be blacklisted.

   **Using AWS WAF for IP Filtering:**
   - **Whitelist Legitimate Crawler IPs:** AWS WAF allows you to create **IP Sets** for trusted IP ranges, such as those used by Googlebot or Bingbot.
   - **Blacklist Known Malicious IPs:** Similarly, you can block specific IP ranges that are known to be used by malicious bots.

   **Steps to Implement IP Filtering in AWS WAF:**
   1. Create a new **IP Set** with the IP ranges for legitimate crawlers (this may need regular updating).
   2. Create a **Web ACL** in AWS WAF and apply it to your CloudFront distribution.
   3. Add rules to **allow requests** from the whitelisted IP set and **block requests** from blacklisted IPs.

4. **Using a `robots.txt` File:**
   - The `robots.txt` file is used to guide compliant bots about which parts of the site they are allowed to crawl. However, not all bots follow `robots.txt`, so it’s not a security measure but a guideline for well-behaved bots.

   **Example Configuration:**
   ```txt
   User-agent: Googlebot
   Disallow: /private/
   
   User-agent: Bingbot
   Disallow: /private/
   
   User-agent: *
   Disallow: /sensitive-data/
   ```

5. **Monitoring and Analysis:**
   - **Log Analysis:** Regularly review server logs (e.g., CloudFront logs) to identify suspicious activity or malicious bots. Look for unusual patterns, like high request rates or User-Agents trying to bypass restrictions.
   - **Behavioral Analysis:** Analyze traffic behavior to block patterns indicative of bots that evade User-Agent or IP-based filters. This can include using services like **Amazon Athena** to query logs stored in S3 for deeper insights.

6. **Additional Measures:**
   - **Rate Limiting:** You can implement **rate limiting** to prevent any bot (even legitimate ones) from overloading the server by making too many requests. This can be done via AWS WAF by creating **rate-based rules**.
   - **CAPTCHA:** For sensitive areas of the website, adding a CAPTCHA challenge can block bots while allowing human users to continue.

### **d) Monitoring**

#### **Objective:**
To monitor the health, performance, and security of the CloudFront distribution and the Next.js application running on AWS Lambda.

#### **Key Metrics to Monitor:**

1. **CloudFront Metrics**:
   - **Requests**: Total number of requests made to the distribution.
   - **Cache Hit Ratio**: Percentage of requests served from CloudFront’s cache.
   - **Latency**: The time taken by CloudFront to respond to requests.
   - **4xx/5xx Errors**: Number of 4xx (client errors) and 5xx (server errors) occurring on the CloudFront distribution.

2. **Lambda Metrics** (for Next.js application):
   - **Invocation Count**: Number of times the Lambda function is invoked.
   - **Duration**: Average execution time of Lambda functions.
   - **Error Count**: Count of errors generated during Lambda function execution.

#### **Logging and Analysis:**

1. **Enable CloudFront Logs**:
   - Activate **Standard Logging** for CloudFront and store logs in an S3 bucket.
   - Configure S3 bucket lifecycle rules to archive or delete old logs to manage storage costs.

2. **CloudWatch Metrics**:
   - Set up **CloudWatch dashboards** to monitor key CloudFront and Lambda metrics in real-time.
   - Use **CloudWatch Alarms** to trigger alerts for high error rates or unusual latency spikes.

3. **Analyze Logs Using Athena**:
   - Use **Amazon Athena** to query and analyze CloudFront logs stored in S3. This allows you to run custom queries to identify traffic patterns, potential issues, and trends over time.

### **e) Site Loading Time Optimization**

#### **Objective:**
To reduce site loading time and improve user experience using CloudFront features.

#### **Proposed Optimization Methods:**

1. **Leverage CloudFront Caching**:
   - Use the **Cache-Control** header in the Next.js application to ensure that static assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, images) are cached by CloudFront.
   - Set **long cache durations** (e.g., `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000`) for immutable assets to avoid frequent origin requests.

   **Code Example (Next.js)**:
   ```js
   export async function getServerSideProps() {
     return {
       props: {},
       headers: {
         'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
       },
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Enable Origin Shield**:
   - **Origin Shield** adds an additional caching layer between CloudFront edge locations and the origin, reducing the number of direct requests to the origin and improving cache hit ratios.
   
   **Steps to Enable Origin Shield**:
   1. In the **CloudFront console**, go to **Settings**.
   2. Under the **Origin Shield** section, select an AWS region to use as the shield.

3. **Optimize Image Delivery**:
   - Use **Lambda@Edge** to dynamically resize and compress images based on device type and screen resolution. This ensures faster image loading without impacting quality.
   
   **Lambda@Edge Function Example**:
   - Create a Lambda@Edge function that optimizes images before serving them to the end-user, reducing payload size and improving page load time.

#### **Measuring the Impact**:

1. **CloudFront Metrics**:
   - Monitor **Cache Hit Ratio** to measure how effectively CloudFront is caching responses.
   - Track **Latency** metrics to see if response times improve after optimizations.

2. **Google Lighthouse**:
   - Use **Google Lighthouse** to measure key performance indicators like **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** and **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** before and after optimization.

3. **Synthetic Monitoring**:
   - Set up **Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics** to simulate user interactions and measure site loading time across different geographic locations.

### **Conclusion:**

By implementing these strategies and optimizations, the Next.js application hosted on AWS Lambda with CloudFront can achieve high availability, reduced exposure to bot attacks, efficient monitoring, and improved performance, ensuring a better user experience and operational reliability.
