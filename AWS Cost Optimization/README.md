### AWS Cost Optimization

1. **EC2 Instances ($135.57)**
   - **Optimization Suggestion**: Consider **Right-Sizing** EC2 instances by evaluating the performance metrics. If the current instances are underutilized, downgrade to smaller instance types or switch to **Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads.
   - **Potential Savings**: Up to 30-50% for Spot Instances or right-sizing instances to match actual resource needs.
   - **Trade-Off**: Spot Instances can be interrupted, so they are not suitable for all workloads. Right-sizing requires performance monitoring to ensure applications are still running efficiently.

2. **Lambda Functions ($418.41)**
   - **Optimization Suggestion**: Optimize function code to reduce execution time, increase memory efficiency, and eliminate idle periods. Use **AWS Lambda Power Tuning** to find the optimal memory configuration.
   - **Potential Savings**: Reducing function execution time and adjusting memory can lead to savings of 20-30%.
   - **Trade-Off**: This requires performance testing and might involve reworking existing function logic.

3. **CloudWatch Logs & Monitoring ($73.69)**
   - **Optimization Suggestion**: Set appropriate **retention policies** for logs. Delete unnecessary logs or move them to **S3** for long-term, cheaper storage.
   - **Potential Savings**: CloudWatch cost reduction by 40-50% through better log retention management.
   - **Trade-Off**: Losing quick access to logs that are moved or deleted, which could impact troubleshooting.
