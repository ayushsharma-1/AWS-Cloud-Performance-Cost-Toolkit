# AWS Lambda Cost Optimization

## Introduction
This document outlines the strategies to analyze and reduce AWS Lambda costs based on predicted usage parameters for FileSure Pvt Ltd. The primary goal is to optimize costs while maintaining performance during varying traffic patterns.

## Predicted Usage Parameters
- **Total Executions per Month**: ~1.25 million invocations
- **Average Execution Time**: 40 seconds
- **Memory Provisioned**: 512 MB (0.5 GB)
- **Total Compute Cost**: Approximately $418.41

## Key Observations
1. **Usage Pattern**: The usage graph indicates a low baseline with occasional spikes, particularly around specific peak periods during the month. This suggests that while there are brief periods of high activity, most of the month experiences minimal usage.

## Strategies to Reduce AWS Lambda Costs

### 1. Use Provisioned Concurrency for Predictable Peak Periods
- **Benefits**: Ensures functions are pre-warmed for expected spikes, reducing cold start delays and improving responsiveness.
- **Implementation**: Schedule Provisioned Concurrency during identified peak periods (e.g., the spike in the middle of the month).
- **Trade-offs**: Increased costs during low-traffic periods if not carefully managed.

### 2. Memory and Execution Time Optimization
- **Right-Size Memory**: Adjust memory allocation based on execution metrics.
- **Benefits**: Decreasing memory can lead to cost savings while maintaining performance for fast-executing functions.
- **Trade-offs**: Lower memory could increase execution time, necessitating careful monitoring and adjustments.

### 3. Optimize for High Traffic on Peak Days
- **Dynamic Memory Adjustments**: Auto-scale Lambda's memory during high-traffic days (e.g., 19thâ€“21st).
- **Benefits**: Only pay for increased memory when necessary, leading to significant savings.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires advanced logic to predict peak days accurately.

### 4. Use AWS Compute Savings Plans
- **Benefits**: Lower rates for consistent usage, offering discounts up to 66% compared to on-demand pricing.
- **Trade-offs**: Commitment to a one or three-year plan could lead to higher costs if usage fluctuates unexpectedly.

### 5. Utilize S3 for Background Processing
- **Offload Tasks**: Use S3 for tasks like file uploads and logs, reducing Lambda execution times and freeing up memory for other processes.
- **Benefits**: Can significantly lower execution costs.

### 6. Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for Cost Control
- **Implementation**: Create alarms for execution time, memory usage, and invocation counts.
- **Benefits**: Receive alerts when thresholds are crossed, allowing for immediate adjustments to prevent cost overruns.

### 7. Leverage Request-Based Auto-Scaling for Spikes
- **Dynamic Concurrency**: Utilize AWS Lambda's auto-scaling features to adjust concurrency based on incoming requests.
- **Benefits**: Reduces the need for manual adjustments and ensures cost efficiency during traffic surges.

## Summary of Cost-Saving Strategies
1. Implement Provisioned Concurrency during predictable peak traffic periods.
2. Optimize memory allocation dynamically to match traffic patterns, reducing costs during regular days.
3. Consider Compute Savings Plans for consistent low-level traffic.
4. Use CloudWatch Alarms and auto-scaling to adapt to unexpected spikes in usage.

## Trade-offs Between Memory and Compute Costs
- **Higher Memory Allocation**:
  - Benefits: Faster execution times and improved performance during high traffic.
  - Costs: Increased compute costs, especially during low traffic periods.

- **Lower Memory Allocation**:
  - Benefits: Reduced costs during normal usage.
  - Risks: Potentially slower execution times if memory is insufficient, leading to longer processing times.

### Conclusion
By implementing the above strategies, FileSure Pvt Ltd can effectively manage and reduce AWS Lambda costs while ensuring performance during peak usage times. Continuous monitoring and adjustments will be crucial for optimizing resource allocation and minimizing expenses.
