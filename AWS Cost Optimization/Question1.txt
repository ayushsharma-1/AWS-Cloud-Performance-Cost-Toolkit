Based on the pattern from the graph you shared earlier and the information we've worked through regarding the cost structure, here's how we can analyze and reduce the AWS Lambda costs effectively:

Key Observations:
Low Baseline with Spikes:
The graph shows a consistently low baseline in terms of usage, with one major spike in the middle of the month.
This suggests infrequent periods of heavy use followed by long periods of minimal traffic.
Strategies to Reduce Lambda Costs:
1. Use Provisioned Concurrency for the Predictable Peak Period
How it helps: Instead of relying on AWS to scale on-demand, you can configure Provisioned Concurrency only for the periods where spikes occur. This ensures that functions are ready to handle traffic without cold starts during peak times, saving money by avoiding over-provisioning throughout the month.
Implementation: For example, you could use scheduled scaling based on known patterns (such as the spike in usage in the middle of the month).
Trade-offs: Provisioned concurrency can lead to higher costs during low-traffic periods, so use it only for peak traffic periods to ensure balance.
2. Memory and Execution Time Optimization
Right-Size the Memory: Based on execution time metrics, it’s important to allocate just enough memory to keep performance optimal without over-allocating.
How it helps: If the majority of Lambda executions complete quickly, you may not need as much memory. Decreasing the memory allocation can reduce costs while still maintaining function performance.
Trade-offs: Reducing memory could increase execution time. You would need to balance memory allocation and execution time carefully through monitoring.
3. Optimize for High Traffic on Peak Days
Auto-Scaling with Dynamic Memory Adjustments: Based on the pattern, you can auto-scale the Lambda function's memory capacity on high-traffic days (for instance, the 19th–21st), while keeping it low during the rest of the month.
Potential Savings: Dynamically scaling only during peak times could significantly reduce costs, as you are only paying for higher memory when needed.
Trade-offs: This may require implementing additional logic to identify peak traffic days in advance.
4. Use AWS Compute Savings Plans for Consistent Low Traffic
How it helps: Since there is a consistent low-level traffic baseline, adopting Compute Savings Plans could reduce overall Lambda costs by providing cheaper rates for consistent usage.
Potential Savings: AWS Compute Savings Plans offer discounts up to 66% over on-demand usage. These plans work best for consistent, predictable usage.
Trade-offs: You commit to a one or three-year plan, which locks you into paying for certain usage regardless of whether you fully use it.
5. Use S3 for Background Processing
If your function handles tasks like file uploads, logs, or data storage, consider offloading some of this work to S3 using event-driven architectures. This can reduce Lambda execution costs and free up memory for other tasks.
6. Use CloudWatch to Set Alarms for Cost Control
How it helps: Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify you when Lambda usage crosses a certain threshold. If there are unexpected increases in traffic or execution time, you can get notified and adjust your Lambda settings immediately to avoid runaway costs.
Implementation: Create alarms for execution time, memory usage, and invocation count.
7. Leverage Request-Based Auto-Scaling for Spikes
Instead of manually predicting spikes, you can use AWS Lambda’s auto-scaling features, which automatically adjust concurrency based on the number of requests. Set policies to handle significant spikes (like those seen in the graph).
Benefit: This reduces the need for guesswork in memory allocation, ensuring you only pay for the resources when traffic surges.
Summary:
Cost Saving Strategy:
Implement Provisioned Concurrency only during predictable traffic peaks.
Reduce memory allocation for regular traffic days and scale memory up dynamically for peak times.
Consider Compute Savings Plans for consistent baseline traffic.
Use CloudWatch Alarms and auto-scaling to dynamically adjust based on traffic surges.
